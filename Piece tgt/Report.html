Introduction:
Website is a newsletter on crochet. It provides a platform for crochet lovers to come together to share information about crochet so that they can benefit from each other. The website is in a top-down hierarchy.

Inspiration: 
I have came across a facebook post on Singapore crochet artist, Kelly Limerick. I was intrigued by her artworks, especially the one where she crochet using pink yarn over seats and bicycle. Through the video, I learnt the term 'crochet' and it also helps me widen my perspective of crochet and knitting. My previous perspective is that only elderly would knit and the only product will be clothing. But from the facebook post I have learnt that there is so much thing could be created from crochet and crochet can be for any ages. As such, this gave me an inspiration to create this website on crochet, so that more people can learn about crochet. 

As I have started my crochet journey, I have came across an Instagram account, @WEcrochet.sg. This account was created by a crocheter, @bunnyandyarn. The purpose is to provide a platform to increase exposure for crocheters. This is my second inspiration to create this website, helping to increase exposure for crocheters and also to provide them a platform for them to exchange information on crochet.

During the circuit breaker in Singapore, I was stucked at home and came across many people starting up small business during the period. A lot of people had started a small business with their passion. This inspires me to create a website so that I can provides a platform for them to martket their own products for crocheters.
